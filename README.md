# Sound-Keyboard
Fun practice project with PaperJS.
This project is an assignment from the Web Developer Boot Camp on Udemy by Colt Steel. 
-Each letter on the keyboard is assigned a sound and a color
-When user presses a letter key, a sound will play and a circle will appear randomly on the screen and gradually shrink until it dissappears.

Some fun functionality I want to add to this project later on. 
-User can type a sentence and "listen" to the sentence when they press play.
